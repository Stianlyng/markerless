--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is nan px, which roughly corresponds to nan mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
In average, 0.45 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera int_cam1_img was excluded 23% of the time, Camera int_cam2_img: 6%, and Camera int_cam3_img: 15%.
Limb swapping was not handled.
Lens distortions were not taken into account.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 9.5 px, which roughly corresponds to 39.6 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
In average, 1.11 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera int_cam1_img was excluded 90% of the time, Camera int_cam2_img: 14%, and Camera int_cam3_img: 60%.
Limb swapping was not handled.
Lens distortions were not taken into account.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 7.3 px, which roughly corresponds to 29.5 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
In average, 1.11 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera int_cam1_img was excluded 90% of the time, Camera int_cam2_img: 15%, and Camera int_cam3_img: 42%.
Limb swapping was not handled.
Lens distortions were not taken into account.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 7.3 px, which roughly corresponds to 29.5 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
In average, 1.11 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera int_cam1_img was excluded 90% of the time, Camera int_cam2_img: 15%, and Camera int_cam3_img: 42%.
Limb swapping was not handled.
Lens distortions were not taken into account.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 7.3 px, which roughly corresponds to 29.5 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 15 px.
In average, 1.11 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera int_cam1_img was excluded 90% of the time, Camera int_cam2_img: 15%, and Camera int_cam3_img: 42%.
Limb swapping was not handled.
Lens distortions were not taken into account.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 21.4 px, which roughly corresponds to 86.4 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.3 and if the reprojection error was above 50 px.
In average, 1.11 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera int_cam1_img was excluded 69% of the time, Camera int_cam2_img: 15%, and Camera int_cam3_img: 42%.
Limb swapping was not handled.
Lens distortions were not taken into account.
